## Install

*jersi_certu* has been developed using Python 3.8.5. So it is better to have installed such version or some higher version. 

### Instructions for Windows and Linux platforms

1. Make an installation directory by either cloning this *git* repository or downloading it as a zip archive and unzipping it.
2. Move into the installation directory, where the `README.md` file seats.
3. Execute `jersi_start.py`: the first time a Python virtual environment is created and the required dependencies are downloaded and installed; then GUI is started. The next times, just the GUI is started.
4. For un-installing *jersi_certu* just remove the installation directory.
5. The above instructions might also work on other platforms, but only Windows and Linux have been tested.

### Used dependencies

For information, *jersi_certu* relies on the following packages:

- *Pillow* : for converting and resizing images used in the GUI;
- *MCTS*  : for implementing experimental AI agents.
