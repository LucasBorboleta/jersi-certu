# TODO
The foreseen tasks on jersi-certi are as follows:

- [ ] Test the ending rule "no possible move" for the opponent.
- [ ] Start a first IA that decides for random but valid moves.
- [ ] Re-read in order to check the design.
- [ ] Complete documentation and information relevant for GitHub publishing (code of conduct, etc.).
